# Assignment 2: Simple Library Management System

## Write a Python program that simulates a basic library system:

-   Store a list of books (e.g., ['Python Basics', 'Data Science 101', 'AI for Beginners']).
-   Allow users to:
    -   View available books (view).
    -   Borrow a book (borrow).
    -   Return a book (return).
-   Use loops to allow users to perform multiple actions until they quit.
-   Write separate functions (view_books, borrow_book, return_book) for each action.
-   Update the list of books dynamically based on user actions.
